                            <h4 id="inno-final">Innovation for a designated few</h4>
                            Traditional organizations set up an innovation lab or create an R&D department that is accessible to a designated few.
                            <h4>Rigid organizational structure</h4>
                            The capability creation stays at the periphery of the organization, away from the mainstream teams, resulting in the management failing to see the bigger picture.
                            <h4>Too much focus on future</h4>
                            In some firms, the philosophy of letting a thousand flowers bloom spawns innovation overload. Being overtly futuristic can cause a serious dent in such organization’s way of growth and innovation plans.

                                Traversing this path, we initially started with a process for innovation. However, the journey witnessed its own challenges. We saw
                                ideators abandoning their ideas halfway, lac of support from business
                                sponsors to take the idea to the next level, non-ideators jumping in an ideas deviating from the goal and taking it into a different direction without any validation from sponsors or customers. People were celebrationg the insignificant more while our significant progress-makers were complaining of ignorance.

                                    To our surprise, we found out that it didn’t happen on those intelligently crafted three steps. We eventually realised <strong>that innovation is not a workflow rather a complex interplay.</strong> Where we start, how we progress and what goes live - none of that follow a linear path. The ideas that went live were those that flowed where the innovation energy is - in terms of ideators’ passion, incubation alignment and business sponsorship.

It channels the energy of voluntary innovation in the organisation towards achieving real business value. The MindTrust consists of a group of senior stakeholders from the Business and Technology, to whom ideas are pitched in the form of prototypes or proof of concepts (PoCs). They can then approve, kill or pivot these ideas. In doing so, the MT acts both as an accelerator and a mechanism for fast and lean customer feedback.</p>

For any organisation, focusing about 70% of the energy on reaching the final destination is crucial. Hence, innovators need a mechanism for feedback to shape an idea, negotiate for sponsorship, or drop the idea altogether.
                                                                                </p>

Even when an idea is being shut down, after the initial disappointment, true ideators are quick enough to channelize their energy into the next viable idea. This produces a much better outcome than disillusioning them and switching them off from the organisational innovation energy.
                                                                                </p>
